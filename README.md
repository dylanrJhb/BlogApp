# BlogApp
This is a simple iOS app which fetches data from the api, https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts. This then displays a list of blogs where the user can select a blog post to view the whole post as well as then go in to the comments for that post. This project was made using MVVM architecture and can be run by downloading the project and running it in xCode.
